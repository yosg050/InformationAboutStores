I developed a basic website for finding stores as a volunteer project to help a non-profit organization that supports families in need.

The site provides a user-friendly list of stores that accept a special card distributed to these families.

Previously, the organization only provided an Excel file with all the data, which was not user-friendly.

Since the card is distributed before the holidays, I started the project just a few days before Sukkot and aimed to have it live before the holiday. This left me with only two days to complete the work. 

Given this tight timeline, which included data handling, I decided to forgo using a database and instead chose a JSON file for data storage, with filtering handled on the front end
